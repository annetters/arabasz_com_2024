Working on a revamp of my portfolio website to make use of more recent technology. The current site (https://arabasz.com) was great and modern at the time, but CSS and JS has come a long way since then and I want to incorporate that.

## What's the code stack?
* HTML
* CSS/SCSS
* Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/)

## How to run

* `build` runs a build to build the application for production usage
* `start` runs starts  production server
